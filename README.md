My process:
HTML
CSS
Flexbox

What I learned:
This challenge was really helpful in buckling down some of the basics of responsive design. I tend or avoid using Bootstrap for now because I really want to nail the basics.

Continued Development:
I am still not completely comfortable with the media query and responsiveness; however, these challenges are definitely helping me alot more with understanding it. 

Feedback is always welcome! <3
